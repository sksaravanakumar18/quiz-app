      "caseStudyText": "<h1>Cymbal Direct</h1><h2>Company overview</h2><p>Cymbal Direct is an online direct-to-consumer Chicago-based footwear and apparel retailer founded in 2008 and acquired by Cymbal Group in 2010. Cymbal Direct is a fair trade and B Corp certified, sustainability-focused company that works with cotton farmers to reinvest in their communities, a fact which appeals to Cymbal Direct's younger target market demographic.</p><h2>Solution concept</h2><ol><li>The beta Delivery by Drone initiative enables licensed drone pilots to team up with Cymbal Direct to deliver shoes and sandals to customers via drone. DBD allows customers to place their orders and then get their shoes delivered in an expedited amount of time. The drones stream real-time video to their pilots, as well as their coordinates, so that customers can see the location of their shoes on a map.</li><li>Cymbal Direct wants to release official APIs for partners. APIs will be published in a controllable, versionable way, with the ability to track, secure and monetize.</li><li>A social integration service initiative which highlights images hashtagged with Cymbal Direct's products using machine learning to ensure images are appropriate. The social media highlighting service is currently proof-of-concept. Built by a developer in their own time after hours as an experiment, the service garnered a lot of excitement and interest, especially from the marketing team. During one of the internal demos, however, inappropriate images were included in the product gallery.</li></ol><h2>Existing technical environment</h2><p>Delivery by Drone is an experiment by the supply chain and logistics team. Their core customer-facing application does order processing, showing the current status and location of their delivery. The drones connect via the cellular network. The drones use the drone API to receive commands and send real-time information and video about their location and status. The existing technical environment includes: A website frontend and pilot and truck management systems run on Kubernetes. Positional data for drone and truck location kept in MongoDB database clusters. Drones connected to virtual machines using a stateful connection, streaming video via RTMP to the pilots and sending commands from the pilots to the drones.</p><p>Purchase & Product APIs were developed over time as the business was being built. They were initially only intended to be used in-house, and not exposed to 3rd parties and partners. Many of the APIs are simply built into monolithic apps, and were not designed for partner integration, lacking functionality such as versioning. The majority of the APIs run on Ubuntu Linux VMs, and scaling has been somewhat difficult because of the use of virtual machines and monolithic architecture. APIs do not have a built-in mechanism for supporting multiple accounts and granting access is very limited as a result.</p><p>The social media highlighting service currently runs on a single virtual machine (SuSE linux, MySQL DB, Redis, Python), and while it does work, it has some performance and scalability issues.</p><h2>Business requirements</h2><ul><li>Easily scale to handle additional demand when needed and expand to more test markets.</li><li>Streamline development for application modernization and new features/products.</li><li>Ensure that developers spend as much time on core business functionality as possible, and not have to worry about scalability wherever possible.</li><li>Let partners order directly via API.</li><li>Deploy a production version of the social media highlighting service and ensure no inappropriate content.</li></ul><h2>Technical requirements</h2><ul><li>Move to managed services wherever possible.</li><li>Ensure that developers can deploy container-based workloads to testing and production environments in a highly scalable environment.</li><li>Standardize on containers where possible, but also allow for existing virtualization infrastructure to run as-is without a re-write, so it can be slowly refactored over time.</li><li>Securely allow partner integration.</li><li>Stream IoT data from drones.</li></ul><h2>Executive statement</h2><p>Cymbal Direct has three areas of strategic focus: improving customer experience, leveraging analytics, and improving digital marketing. Cymbal Direct has experienced rapid growth and has had trouble meeting demand. The organization wants to implement solutions that will help scale services and personalize customer experiences. Cymbal Direct wants to be able to dynamically surge delivery during peak periods. Cymbal Direct also wants to be able to facilitate large scale B2B orders and better predict customer demand and trends. The organization wants to ensure the security of its B2B partners' business plans and make it easier for those partners to integrate with Cymbal Direct's APIs to submit orders and specify customizations. Cymbal Direct also wants to integrate social media and marketing applications into its platform. They would like to be able to highlight posts on social media platforms which feature Cymbal Direct products directly on their product pages, but are concerned about the possibility of having unsavory content shown to users accidentally.</p>"

The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, ecommerce, referrals, and a freemium app model. The application has grown from a few servers in the founder's garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a colocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application's rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company's desire to innovate faster, Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud.</p><h2>Solution concept</h2><p>For the first phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4Win is moving their development and test environments. They are also building a disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location. They are not sure which components of their architecture they can migrate as is and which components they need to change before migrating them.</p><h2>Existing Technical Environment</h2><p>The Dress4Win application is served out of a single data center location. All servers run Ubuntu LTS v16.04.</p><p><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL. One server for user data, inventory, static data (MySQL 5.7, 8 core CPUs, 128 GB of RAM, 2x 5 TB HDD (RAID 1)).</p><p><strong>Compute:</strong> 40 web application servers providing micro-services based APIs and static content (Tomcat - Java, Nginx, Four core CPUs, 32 GB of RAM). 20 Apache Hadoop/Spark servers (Data analysis, Real-time trending calculations, Eight core CPUs, 128 GB of RAM, 4x 5 TB HDD (RAID 1)). Three RabbitMQ servers for messaging, social notifications, and events (Eight core CPUs, 32GB of RAM).

Fibre channel SAN - MySQL databases (1 PB total storage; 400 TB available). NAS - image storage, logs, backups (100 TB total storage; 35 TB available).</p><h2>Business Requirements</h2><ul><li>Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled parity of production.</li><li>Improve security by defining and adhering to a set of security and identity and access management (IAM) best practices for cloud.</li><li>Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources.</li><li>Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud.</li></ul><h2>Technical requirements</h2><ul><li>Easily create non-production environments in the cloud.</li><li>Implement an automation framework for provisioning resources in cloud.</li><li>Implement a continuous deployment process for deploying applications to the on-premises data center or cloud.</li><li>Support failover of the production environment to cloud during an emergency.</li><li>Encrypt data on the wire and at rest.</li><li>Support multiple private connections between the production data center and cloud environment.</li></ul><h2>Executive statement</h2><p>Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and free them to focus on developing better features. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle. Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next five years for a public cloud strategy achieves a cost reduction between 30% and 50% over our current model.</p>"
